# CSVonFHIR
Project developed during the #codevscovid19 hackathon in 2020.

## Introduction
### Goal
The goal of this project is to create a dynamic parser which generates FHIR document based on a CSV input and then populates
this FHIR document with the CSV data.

### Purpose of this project
[FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/index.html) is a standard which describes data formats and resources as well as an API for
exchanging electronic health records. 
Since hospitals and other health care parties use a variety of systems and services it becomes difficult to exchange data
in a fast and meaningful way. 
Furthermore, adopting a new standard is often times coupled with a lot of effort. 
We try to tackle part of what causes this problem by creating an easy way to convert patient data stored in a CSV format 
into the FHIR format. 
This will offer an easy way to make data accessible and sharable between various groups without much effort.
