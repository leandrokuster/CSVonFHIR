# patientdataconsolidater
Project developed during the #codevscovid19 hackathon in 2020

## Overview
This service prepares data from various source-systems and creates an output in the ML7 FHIR format. 
The idea behind it is that health care centers, hospitals, doctors etc. can easily share their data with each other in a standardized format. 
Since it is a REST based service it also enables other services that use FHIR to retrieve and utilize data from other source formats.
